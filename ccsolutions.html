          Lecture 2 - Linear Regression (January 28, 2021)
          <ul>
            <li>Question A: Graph 1 is Line 2, Graph 2 is Line 1, Graph 3 is Line 2
            <li>Question B: Graph 1: one or more large residuals, Graph 2: an extreme x value, Graph 3: a pattern in the residuals</li>
            <li>Question C: Colinearity between height and leg length</li>
          </ul>

          Lecture 4 - Linear Classification (February 4, 2021)

            <li>Q1: Hinge and Logistic</li>
            <li>Q2: 0-1</li>
            <li>Q3: Logistic (Hinge is not technically correct, although it is  differentiable almost everywhere)</li>
            <li>Q4: Hinge and Logistic</li>
            <li>Q5: Logistic</li>

          Lecture 5 - Probabilistic Classification (February 9, 2021)
          <ul>
            <li>QA: 0/1 Lines 2 and 3, Hinge Lines 2 and 3, Logistic line 3</li>
            <li>QB: Line 2</li>
            <li>QC: Yes, the unlabeled data seems to help us here, although might not always help</li>
