      <h2>Intro: Diana Acosta-Navas</h2>

      Diana Acosta-Navas was here to speak! Diana is a PhD candidate at the Harvard Philosophy Department and is also an Adjunct Lecturer in Ethics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennnedy School. Because the vast majority of the discussion in class centered around the content in the slides, I decided it'd be more effective for students to reread Diana's slides rather than a recap. Slides linked above!
